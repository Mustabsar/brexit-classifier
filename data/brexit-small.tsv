0	Why is the government not listening to the business people of this country & actually stopping this ridiculous thing called #Brexit.. it will go down in history as an embarrassment to this country.
0	Clever name. That is all.
0	It will be a good lesson never to entrust the rabble with giving their opinions on topics that demand expertise and experience.
1	It was the will of the people; it should be done. And if she can't or won't do it properly, Theresa May has got to go.
1	It is an absurd another referendum on the same shit. People already decided, you cucks!
0	I understand why people felt the way they did, but it’s not helpful to anyone.
0	I think we have embarrassed ourselves and that whatever the outcome, this country is going to be a less pleasant one.
0	Remain. I have a full range of economic, political and social arguments for remaining a member of the EU. But, it all boils down to - I don't want to live on a planet where Nigel Farage is right.
1	I like the people making laws that I have to abide by to be accountable to me and the rest of the public. We haven't yet been allowed to veto any of the laws the EU puts through, and we don't get a vote on who runs the EU. It's a dictatorship with less fewer executions.
0	I feel the leave campaign is purely built on a combination of speculation and bullshit. Remain on the other hand relies on information we have, and we all live in at the moment- which really isn't that bad.
1	I don't feel comfortable with the idea that people that were not elected by the people of my country can make laws that govern my country and be unaccountable for any effects as a result of these laws. It seems very undemocratic, if not anti-democratic.
1	I want our laws to be decided in Westminster not Brussels
1	I don't really like the idea of eurocrats in brussels deciding my future. I have found it amazing seeing friends on Facebook shout passionately about how voting In is the only choice and that believing anything other that that makes me an idiot racist. I have found the In campaign to be the vocal minority. I turn on sky news and it is just seems to be pushing doom and gloom for the UK economy if we leave. The current government just seems to be pushing fear and I am really bored of it.
0	Given that we do so much trade with the countries of the EU I think it's in our national interest to have a say in how the EU is run.
1	I'm voting Leave to escape the United States of Europe, recession be damned. If the economy was such a sacred cow we'd never go into war or subsidise unsustainable industry.
1	There is a little benefit to staying in and Brussels has shown they don't give a fuck about compromises. Only sensible option if you actually want to help our country.
1	I am tired of the EU being able to create our laws and regulations, being told what we can and can not do.
1	The EU is a anti-democratic, bureaucratic monstrosity that only serves itself. It is filled with failed politicians who are paid huge sums of money to do nothing but fill their pockets. The only thing we need in Europe is free trade. Brussels in its current form needs to go down.
1	Restore Britain's national sovereignty and parliamentary democracy
1	I don't want to be ruled by an unelected elite in a federal europe
1	When the first major terror attacks hit Britain due to the fact terrorists can freely enter while pretending to be migrants, then people's opinions will change.
1	You can't put a price on sovereignty.
0	It's bad enough I have to live with a Tory Government. I don't fancy living with an unregulated Tory Government. I value my human rights too much for that.
0	Any financial forecast is guesswork from either side. I think you've got to Base this on what sort of person you want to be, insular and fearful of outsiders and collaboration, or open and willing to help and work with others. I also do think you have to look at who is campaigning on either side, if you want to align yourself with Nigel Farrage and Michael Gove then you get what you deserve.
1	I still believe it will be the best for the country in the long run. It's also interesting to see how the lies on both sides of the campaign are coming to light.
0	So after being turned down for citizenship on grounds of insufficient evidence of integration into life in the uk (teacher & headteacher for 14 years) now my application for settled status can’t go through. 3 attempts and each time the website crashes!
0	This is one of the things I find frustrating about the arguments for #Brexit. The #EU is so much more than just trade. It's social & cultural cooperation for peace & prosperity. I used to work on EU funded research. We're throwing it all away for no benefit. Brexit is pointless.
0	There. Is. No. #Brexit. Opportunity…it is a mythic and made up as unicorns, magic beans , Hogwarts, Middle Earth or Liam Fox’s trade deals. And saying it in a Spectator Leader doesn’t make it any less fantastical.
1	No deal is the best deal. Bollocks to Sky news , they are just EU sympathisers.
1	Wow. The media is really going all out to scare the crap out of the British public into thinking Brexit is bad
1	Borders will be more secure with no deal, not less. Bring it on.
1	Obvious remain propaganda is obvious remain propaganda.
1	that is nonsense. if they say the sky is brown people will be so stupid but to believe them. people wake up and smell the coffee. these corrupt establishment are working for this corrupt European union. they are simply trectrous independent. don't be fooled again. for Christ sakes.
1	Immigrants landing on our beaches in boats, European organised crime operating in the UK already due to open border, jails packed with foreign criminals and the government is all of a sudden concerned.
1	the EU are sucking the blood out of Europe
1	The trade unions used to exist to serve the working class. Now they're in favour of cheap foreign labour and being under the kosh of a corporate/political unelected entity.
0	Brexit sucks, I’m Australian and I got denied access to travel to the UK because they were trying to tighten up the boarders lol. Worst!!!
0	And Brexit is the mistake people never realised they made.
0	Brexit was Putin's idea. Executed flawlessly.
1	It's a conspiracy!! The liberal, Hollywood media wanting to control the out come. We've not left. Yet!?
1	I'm pro-Europe. I'm just anti-Brussels.
1	UK is getting ready to surrender its sovereignty and be governed by UNELECTED and UNACCOUNTABLE WTO bureaucrauts from Switzerland!
0	So when the British economy falls after March 29, 2019, will the Brexshiteers admit that Brexit is a mistake? Or are they going to blame brown people, the EU and George Soros for it?
0	Wales voted for Brexit. WTF were they thinking?
1	Can we please just leave
0	Brits and ties... What are you thinking. But please show Britain out. No deal would be the best for Europe.
1	Anyone else fed up with the propaganda from these Common Purpose led political clowns?
1	Short term pain long term gain.... Bring IT ON!
1	So the EU now has the authority to install hard borders in other nations? (The EU decides whether ireland puts up a border or not?)
1	They should have thought of all this before they joined the shitty Eu
0	Well in fairness. I hope our political/economic turmoil acts as a lesson to the rest of the Europe. A lesson in what not to do.
0	The rest of the world is now showing its 'I told you so' face
1	Brexit ain't broken, we're leaving in March. If we don't then democracy will be broken.
0	It will take a number of generations to get over this mistake, for every country in the EU and the UK. I still can’t understand how the Brits ever got convinced how Brexit was a good idea...
0	Britain taught the world really a lesson! Use your brain before you act blond! Prolong the withdrawal period and drag the rest of Europe in your homemade problems???? No thank you Britain! For One time solve your own problems without the EU blaming for your failures and failings!
0	How can Britain fix Brexit? Simple cancel it if it has any common sense left (which at this point looks very doubtful that it has).
0	Why are people so surprised? Can anyone remember why the UK is actually  leaving? I've lost the plot now. I'm sorry I can't keep up.
1	Brexit is great U.K. will be free soon again
0	Stop being stupid! Abandon Brexit! Abandon insanity!
0	Britain needs to learn to embrace the world and not to fear it. Today you need Brexit tomorrow you will need Wrexit (World Exit). Britain is not happy with Europe. Are they ever satisfied with anything? The world needs to remove borders not build huge and beautiful walls.
0	Sometimes quitting may not be as easy as one thinks!
0	why can't the Queen come out n say that its high time the Brexit is cancelled
1	Brexit is good exciting and about freedom
1	Onwards my british friends, fight for your country and your liberty!
0	If there was a second referendum, and the result was still to leave, that would be the winner for mass stupidity of the century, second to venezuela.
0	People with their lives ahead of them have to suffer the consequences of a choice by those who are nearly dead.
1	Easy. Follow Democratic process and leave the festering globalist pigs in the trough EU.
0	The problem is that everyone saw how Brexit was a bad idea... right after they voted "yes".
0	Answer: Don’t leave the European Union.
1	EU have no power to kidnap Uk
1	Representative democracy, true. But millions of Brits rejected the European representative democracy
1	How about we pay nothing and the eu takes its illegal migrents back.
1	We owe them NOTHING!!!
1	They need us we don't need them
1	The real face of the comunist EU.
0	As a German I am fully prepared to help the Irish. We're a union, not a ramshackle political garbage dump, and unlike such a dump we keep our promises.
1	The EU is setting the Trap to keep you poor souls in, and may is going along with them. I hope there is an explosive demolition charge in the chunnel
1	Decision was made , Act on it no more excuses!
0	I’m fed up with the never ending #Brexit mess. Why don’t they just call it off and get on with solving real problems
0	There’s a connection between the Trump treason and the Brexit - I’ll call that treason too. It’s Wikileaks and Russia’s use of Wikileaks to warp public opinion. I’ve seen photos of Nigel Farage at the front door of that same embassy.
0	If Brexit happens, and it looks like it will, I will forever blame @UKLabour because it has the opportunity to stop but they don’t want to.
0	Brexit has never been about Britain first. It's always been about a small grain of shady business people first. If anything was Britain first it would be staying in the EU.
1	The UK should use its new position post-brexit to implement a more sustainable position on fishing.
1	the EU has demonstrated that leaving the EU not possible without being bullied and harrassed into greeing to still be tied to the EU. Effectively staying in the EU.
0	Don't you realise that if brexit happens there won't even be a UK. Scotland will demand independence as the majority voted remain. We'll be half an island off the coast of a massively successful trading block!
0	I don't really understand what the UK is trying to do here? They wanted out of the EU. Fair enough... That's their choice. But they still want most (If not all) the benefits of being in the EU... But without giving anything back as they're no longer a member? Seems very very strange.
1	I voted to leave for independence and i would vote leave again, Our prime minister May is the problem not Brexit.
1	Brexit Britain Makes Britain Great Britain Again
0	Brexit the the door that opens for the US corporations to asset strip what's left of the UK
1	Leave means leave.
0	The Britain formerly known as Great. Brexit means poverty!
1	I feel like everyone is forgetting that Brexit was voted in?
0	UK told by EU council that Brexit won’t work. What a fucking surprise
1	Switzerland is doing just fine not being in the EU. What’s the difference?
0	We’re fucked here in the UK.
0	Brexit is a load of shite.
0	This is why we shouldn't let old people vote
0	Lets hope it fails
1	It's not working due to none of the elites wanting it to work.
0	Populist plan is poorly thought out and built on lies?! You don't fucking say.
